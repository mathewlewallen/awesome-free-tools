## 🗂️ Rejected or Deferred Tools

This section lists tools that were submitted but **did not make it into the main list**, or were **removed** after reevaluation.

Each tool falls into one of the following categories:

- ❌ **Subpar** – The tool did not meet the quality, usability, or integration standards expected for inclusion.  
- 💤 **Unmaintained** – The tool appears abandoned, with little to no recent development activity or updates.  
- ⏳ **Deferred** – The tool may have potential, but requires further review, testing, or maturity before being added.

> If you're a maintainer of one of these tools and believe it deserves reconsideration, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/mathewlewallen/awesome-free-tools/issues) or [submit a pull request](contributing.md).
